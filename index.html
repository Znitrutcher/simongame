  <h2>How Do You Play?</h2>
  <h2>
    The Simon Game is a simple memory game in which players click 
    on the button corresponding to the button that flashes.
    <br>
    <br>
    For instance, if red flashes, the player clicks on red.
    <br>
    <br>
    Next, if yellow flashes, the player clicks on red, then yellow,
    remembering their pattern.
    <br>
    <br>
    This goes on infinitely, until the player messes up the pattern,
    in which he loses.
